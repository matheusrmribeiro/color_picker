# Color picker
 Challenge #1 - Color Picker

**What I learned?**
* How to use RenderBox to get Widget position
* Read image pixels
* Import and make a CMake file

**Obs**

* On debug mode you may have some delay when capturing images.
* To have a good experience, uses a Medium image quality and run on release mode. _"flutter run -- release"_

**Tested on**
- [X] Android
- [ ] iOS
